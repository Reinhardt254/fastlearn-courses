        FastLearn recognizes the importance of electronic commerce activities to its present day operations.

 

        FastLearn is committed to using e-commerce activities in a cost effective manner that promotes accuracy, safety, security, and efficiency.

 

          These activities bring automation and efficiencies to traditional manual tasks and allow quicker access to information resulting in improved member service.

          Purpose
 

          This e-commerce policy is to be used as both a guideline and an overview in the management of FastLearn electronic services.

 

          Policy Detail
 

          FastLearn is committed to enhancing member service through the use of many forms of e-commerce activities.

 

          Electronic commerce activities include FastLearns web site, email, telephone access system, ACH transactions, ATM system, online bill payment, and home banking services.

 

          They also include business-to-business transactions where interaction is conducted electronically between FastLearn and its business partners using the Internet as the communications network.

 

          It is the practice of FastLearn to safeguard member data at all times, including the processing of e-commerce transactions. Information must be protected at both the sending and receiving ends of each transaction.

 

          To accomplish this, there are several levels of protection applied to e-commerce activities.

 

          Encryption  Encrypting transactions provides security by ensuring that no portion of a transaction is readable except by the parties at each end of the transmission. This ensures that data can be transmitted securely without concern that another party could intercept all or part of the transaction. Encryption also makes certain that the transaction is not tampered with as it routes from point to point and data is received exactly as it was sent. FastLearn will use a minimum of 128b encryption. This also applies to vendors that host FastLearn
 

          Authentication After a secure connection is established, the initiating party must prove his/her identity prior to conducting the transaction. This is typically handled with user IDs or account numbers, along with password or PIN combinations. Additionally, encryption certificates are also employed to validate the authenticity of both servers and users. System administrators control system access by assigning users different levels of access for applications and data. These access levels are determined by senior management and are specific to each job function. This ensures that access to applications and specific types of transactions are only granted as job functions require.

 

          Multi-factor Authentication MFA For online banking, MFA offers more than one form of authentication to verify the legitimacy of a transaction. The layered defense makes it more difficult for an unauthorized person to gain access.

 

        Firewalls FastLearn will deploy and utilize firewalls as necessary to protect internal systems from threats originating from the Internet, as well as those that might be present when connecting to vendors networks. Firewall operating systems and configurations will be reviewed periodically to ensure maximum protection. An audit log will be maintained tracking all attempts to access un-configured blocked services. Firewalls and other access devices will be used, as needed, to limit access to sites or services that are deemed inappropriate or non-corporate in nature. Vendor hosted solution firewalls will be reviewed prior to implementation.

 

        Network Traffic Rules and Restrictions  Intra-network traffic is subject to distinct operating rules and restrictions. Through the use of firewall technology, outside parties are directed only to approved, internal resources. An example of this is web page services that allow certain types of traffic from the Internet (web page browsing) but have other types of traffic blocked (i.e. administrative tasks). This strategy dramatically reduces the risk of any party gaining unauthorized access to a protected server. The internal network is also protected from virus attacks through the use of network-level anti-virus software that is updated automatically on a regular basis. These regular updates are loaded automatically to each PC, as they are available. This provides the most up to date virus protection and security available. E-mail is also scanned prior to delivery, reducing the potential of a virus entering the network in this manner.

 

        Physical Site Security  The entire IT Department is protected by a card access entry system allowing only authorized personnel into the Department. Sensitive data, hardware, and software are secured in tFastLearn data center, which is secured with a card access entry point and is monitored throughout the day by IT staff. Access to the data center is further limited to a small number of authorized personnel. It FastLearn practice to change administrative passwords and immediately remove card access privileges after any change in IT staff. In addition to on-site storage of datFastLearn stores overnight backups of critical systems data and replicated Storage Area Network SAN storage to a secure, off-site location. This ensures that data is available in the event of a disaster or other critical situation.

 

        Staff Training and Review IT staff receives training and reviews all procedures at least annually or as major system additions or changes are implemented.

 

        User Password Maintenance  Staff passwords, on the host data processing system, expire after 45 or 90 days, forcing users to modify their passwords. This control, along with a strict FastLearn policy prohibiting users from sharing or disclosing their passwords, is intended to prohibit unauthorized access to systems and data. After receiving a change in status from the Human Resources Department or other management team members, IT staff immediately removes user access codes from appropriate systems.

 

        Expert Assistance FastLearn recognizes that e-commerce security issues change daily. New threats to security, safety, and accuracy appear daily and system vendors publish updates and patches regularly to eliminate the threat. To assist in the ongoing maintenance of key components of system security, FastLearn will engage, at a regularly scheduled interval, consulting and audit oversight with a nationally recognized leader in the area of e-commerce security. This vendor may also provide technical assistance as new e-commerce related features are added to the system to ensure the continued safety and security of existing systems.

 

        Communications Network  FastLearn employs the use of several types of data communication lines including dial-up phone lines, direct point-to-point circuits, and other private and public network connections. Data transmissions are secured, encrypted, and/or password protected, as needed.

 

        Response Program
 

        In the event FastLearn suspects or detects unauthorized individuals have gained access to member information systems, FastLearn will report such actions to appropriate regulatory and law enforcement agencies according to FastLearn information security response procedures.
